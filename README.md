## DEBUGGING TECHNIQUES

You are reaching the point where the number of run-time errors (where either your program is not giving you the behaviour you want, or is failing with exceptions) outnumbers the number of compile-time errors.

Trying to figure out what's going wrong with these type of errors can be tricky (as you've undoubtedly found out).

Your instructor will give you some tips on what to do when these situations arise.
